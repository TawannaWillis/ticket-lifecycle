To create tickets, users need to access the ticket portal and log in if required. Once in the portal, they can submit a ticket request and describe their IT issues. I’ve created three sample tickets covering a range of problems that might come up in a real-world scenario. Each ticket includes a Help Topic, a detailed description of the issue, and the specifics written out as if composing an email. This setup helps simulate how tickets would be handled in an actual support environment.

As an admin, you'll see incoming ticket requests appear in your panel as soon as they’re submitted. From there, you can reassign tickets to the right agent or team. It’s also your job to set the severity level of each issue to ensure that tickets are resolved within the appropriate SLA. For example, Jane reviewed a ticket, assigned it to the System Administrators, and set the severity level to Emergency to prioritize it accordingly.

Effective communication is key when resolving tickets. It’s essential to keep both your team and the affected users in the loop. As tickets come in with various issues, they’re assigned to the appropriate people for resolution. For instance, Jane handed off a ticket to John, while she managed another ticket on her own. Thorough documentation is also vital for a smooth operation. Properly documenting tickets ensures that you can refer back to them if similar issues arise in the future.

<h1> Key Takeaaways</h1>

The way tickets are managed can vary depending on the work environment. Some places might set a quota for how many tickets need to be resolved within a specific timeframe, and prioritizing tickets will depend on the urgency of each situation. By building osTicket from scratch, I gained valuable insights into ticket management and how it functions in an IT role.
